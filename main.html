   <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity is a way to evaluate how an algorithmâ€™s runtime grows as input size increases; an **efficient** solution keeps this <em>Time complexity</em> as low as possible.</p>

  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the additional memory an algorithm requires, and an algorithm with <em>O(n)</em> space uses memory that scales linearly with the size of its input.</p>
