    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how fast an algorithm runs. An efficient algorithm has low time complexity, making it faster and better for large inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. If an algorithm has O(n) space complexity, it means the memory it uses increases linearly with the input size.</p>
